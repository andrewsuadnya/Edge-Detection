# Digital Image Processing Project

This repository contains the project assignment for the "Digital Image Processing" course. The project focuses on implementing edge detection techniques on images using Python and OpenCV.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop an application that enables users to perform edge detection on images. Users can upload images and select from a range of edge detection operators including Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, Laplace, or Frei-Chen. The application then displays the resulting edge-detected image alongside the original one.

## Features

- Upload images for edge detection
- Select from various edge detection operators
- Display edge-detected image alongside the original

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Flask (web framework)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
4. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to submit bug fixes, feature enhancements, or other improvements.
