## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop an application that enables users to perform edge detection on images. Users can upload images and select from a range of edge detection operators including Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, Laplace, or Frei-Chen. The application then displays the resulting edge-detected image alongside the original one.
